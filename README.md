# maze-solver
(guided project on boot.dev)
A Python application to solve mazes using depth-first search (DFS) or alternative algorithms. This project includes animated visualizations of the maze-solving process, making both learning and debugging delightful and insightful.

Features
Depth-First Search Solution:

Recursively explores each path until the end is reached or all paths are exhausted.
Includes backtracking to find the correct path in case of dead ends.
Visual Animation:

Visualize the maze-solving process step-by-step.
Watch the algorithm make decisions in real-time.
Modular Design:

Easy to modify and extend with other maze-solving algorithms.
Cleanly separated functions and classes for readability and maintainability.
